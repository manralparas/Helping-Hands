        <p><span>Ans-</span>Helping hands is a unique platform for resolving consumer complaints against brands quickly. We help consumers in fighting against injustice, fraud and lousy customer service. We use social media, business network and legal framework to resolve consumer disputes. We take every consumer complaint personally and ensure that we do everything that we can to get the consumer complaints resolved</p><br><br>
        <span>Q- How can I file a consumer complaint?</span>
        <p><span>Ans-</span>You can file a consumer complaint by filling up this form <a href="complaint.html">click here</a>  at our website.</p><br><br>
        <span>Q- Do I need to pay for filing a complaint?</span>
        <p><span>Ans-</span>No, you need not pay anything for filing a free complaint at our website. Infact we will go one step ahead and start a social media campaign & send email to company without any cost to you! However, if you think that your complaint will remain unresolved then you should pay for sending notice to company through registered post and getting documents in prescribed format for approaching consumer forum.</p><br><br>
        <span>Q-</span><span>How much time you will take to resolve my complaint?</span>
        <p><span>Ans-</span>this is the company who actually has to resolve your complaint. Hence, we can not estimate how much time it is going to take to resolve your complaint. We have seen that most of the companies will resolve your complaints quickly but there is no definite timeline.</p><br><br>
        <span>Q- Do I need any evidence in support of my complaint?</span>
        <p><span>Ans-</span>Yes, you need to provide evidence in support of your complaint. A complaint without any valid evidence in support, can not be entertained and will be marked resolved/closed after 20 days. It does not matter if you have made payment for posting complaint or it was posted free. We require evidence in both the cases. Also, the evidence submitted need to be read-able and must be in either Hindi or English.</p><br><br>
        <span>Q- What is the guarantee that my complaint will be resolved?</span>
        <p><span>Ans-</span>There is no 100% guarantee that your complaint will be resolved but rest assured that we will try our best to solve your complaint. However, we can not guarantee any results to you. We have seen that most of the companies will resolve complaints genuinely, if you bring them to their notice. They do not want to loose customers. If the company does not resolve your complaint, we will prepare consumer complaint and give it to you. You can approach your nearest consumer forum for filing consumer complaint.</p>
